To run "Python Main.py"


This is without assets! Create assets folder and download assets there! (Need to create assets/conf and download versions (i.e WIN) there.)

This server only uses ONE port for BOTH api and assets currently http://localhost:5000.. this is only for development! once I fix a few issues I will add a 2 port server!

To patch client to this server use: http://127.0.0.1:5000/conf/
